CS-330 Module 8-3 Journal
What new design skills has your work on project help you to craft?
- I learned many concepts with 3D scenes that greatly improved my skills with design. One example is my knowledge with the basic shapes and how I would utilize this knowledge to breakdown scenes accordingly. I have a more structured approach to planning out my scenes and can determine what would be simpler to recreate vs what would be more difficult and determine my approach to recreate these complex objects. My new skills and understanding of lighting, materials and textures will also help my approach to 3d designs. I am able to accurately determine the type of lighting, what materials would reflect this light and what textures would be utilized and needed to help accurately represent these scenes. 

What design process did you follow for the project?
- I followed a mostly iterative and agile approach for this project. I spent a lot of time planning out my scene and how I would approach and bring this scene to life. And then I worked on my project step by step focusing on each aspect one by one. By separating each goal and task it made the project much more manageable and easier to repeat or go back to modify previous work.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
- This tactic is very versatile and can be applied to many other areas beyond OpenGl and 3d scenes. Utilizing iterative agile approaches can be very beneficial and can simplify complicated projects and tasks. Maintaining an agile approach can help maintain flexibility. 



What new development strategies did you use while woking on your 3d Scene?
- The utilization of 3d elements and implementing them within my design was a new strategy that I used when working on my 3d scene. This made me stayed focused on a deign approach and focused on new elements that I have never used prior to this project.

How did iteration factor into development?
- Iteration was a core concept the development of my project. My project was broken down into sections and objectives were worked on part by part. This greatly simplified the project and made it much more manageable and easier to tackle.

How did your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones which led to projects completion?
- My approach grew wider and more in depth as I went through the milestones. I held onto previous knowledge whilst learning new things and I was able to differentiate issues and recognize where problems arose and where I had to go back. As I went through the milestones I had a stronger grasp of this subject.

How do Computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge that can be applied in your future educational pathway
- I gained a lot more knowledge of graphics and visualizations. Future classes I may take may utilize this knowledge, and what I learned here will be crucial for the success within those subjects and will help me grow and develop these skills further. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge that can be applied in your future professional pathway
- This knowledge has expanded my horizon and abilities. Giving me more versatility with my choices and professional growth. I have a deeper understanding of more subjects that will help me aid my team members and open more opportunities and career paths for me.
